## Three organising questions [@Crenshaw1981]

- Terrorist violence communicates a political message; its ends go beyond damaging an enemy's material resources

. . . 

1. [why]{style="color:cadetblue;"} does terrorism occur? 
    + *predictive*/*causal* questions

. . . 

2. [how]{style="color:cadetblue;"} do the processes of terrorism work?
    + *processual*/*mechanistic* questions

. . . 

3. [what]{style="color:cadetblue;"} are its social and political [effects]{style="color:cadetblue;"}?
    + *descriptive* and *causal* questions

## Common problems [@Crenshaw1981]

(still applicable to significant portions of political violence and research several decades on...)

. . . 

- [logical comparability]{style="color:goldenrod;"} 
- specification of the [relationship of variables]{style="color:purple;"} to each other
- [rank-ordering of variables]{style="color:forestgreen;"} in terms of explanatory power

## 3 levels of causation [@Crenshaw1981]

(1) broad environment/contextual factors ([macro-level]{style="color:red;"})

(2) circumstances and actors ([meso-level]{style="color:red;"})

(3) psychological variables that encourage or inhibit ([micro-level]{style="color:red;"})

- these *levels* are a useful and widely applicable analytical framework

## Context (macro-level): preconditions

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**[Any ideas what is depicted here?]{style="color:indigo; font-size:60px;"}** 
:::

![](slide_files/02/nv_1879_train.png)

## Context (macro-level): preconditions

- [preconditions]{style="color:darkred;"}, factors setting stage for terrorism over the long run
    + enabling or permissive factors provide opportunities <!-- for terrorism to happen -->
        * e.g., [modernisation]{style="color:cadetblue;"} - Narodnaya Volya: operating in imperial Russia made possible by rail infrastructure
        * e.g., [urbanisation]{style="color:cadetblue;"} - 19th century urban development of Paris by Haussman: riots and barricades less feasible, terrorism provides an alternative
        * e.g., [absence of effective security measures]{style="color:cadetblue;"} - "necessary"
    + situations that directly inspire and motivate terrorist campaigns
        * [grievances]{style="color:darkred;"}: e.g., group-based discrimination, [relative deprivation]{style="color:darkred;"} (*Revisionist History* podcast: '[Saigon, 1965](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/revisionist-history/saigon-1965)')
        * *lack of opportunity for political participation* 

## Context (macro-level): precipitants

- [precipitants]{style="color:darkred;"}, specific events that immediately precede the occurrence of terrorism  

> a common pattern of government actions that act as catalysts for terrorism. Government use of unexpected and unusual force in response to protestor reform attempts often compels terrorist retaliation. (p384)

[Examples?]{style="color:indigo;"}

## Context (macro-level): precipitants

- [precipitants]{style="color:darkred;"}, specific events that immediately precede the occurrence of terrorism  

> a common pattern of government actions that act as catalysts for terrorism. Government use of unexpected and unusual force in response to protestor reform attempts often compels terrorist retaliation. (p384)

[Examples?]{style="color:indigo;"}

- execution of 1916 Easter Rising heroes in Ireland
- Protestant violence in response to Catholic civil rights movement in northern Ireland
- RAF emerges after 1968 Beno Ohnesorg death by police violence

## Circumstances (meso-level) [@Crenshaw1981] 

- terrorist behaviour as "rational" 
    + based on assumption that terrorist organisations have consistent sets of values, beliefs, and images of the environment. Hence, terrorism is seen collectively as a logical means  
    
- variety of [goals]{style="color:darkred;"} 
    + from revolutionary - e.g., new state, new system
    + to (essentially) conservative - e.g., preserve social group relations, power arrangements

<!-- It is possible that anarchist or millenarian terrorists are so preoccupied with the splendor of the future that they lose sight of the present. Less theoretical nationalists who concentrate on the short run have simpler aims but sharper plans. -->

## Circumstances (meso-level): variety of goals [@Crenshaw1981] 

- can serve long-term [strategy]{style="color:darkred;"} and/or proximate objectives
- gain attention, win support
- disrupt/discredit government/state
- provoke reactions:
    + affects public attitudes positively and negatively, creating either sympathy in a potential constituency or fear and hostility in an audience identified as the "enemy."
    + government counteraction
- internal organisation functions: control, discipline, morale-building
- actors' impatience

## Circumstances (meso-level) [@Crenshaw1981] 

> The observation that terrorism is a [weapon of the weak]{style="color:violet;"} is hackneyed but apt. (p387)

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
**[What does this mean? Do you agree?]{style="color:indigo; font-size:60px;"}** 
:::

. . . 

- inexpensive, simple
- contrast: James C. Scott's book (1985), *Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance*

## Psychological (micro-level): common traits [@Crenshaw1981] 

two fundamental questions about the psychological basis of terrorism:

1. why the individual takes the first step and chooses to engage in terrorism: why join? Does the terrorist possess specific psychological predispositions, identifiable in advance, that suit them for terrorism? 
    + [radicalisation]{style="color:darkred;"} and [engagement]{style="color:darkred;"} 

. . . 

2. Why does involvement continue? What are the psychological mechanisms of group interaction?
    + [persistence]{style="color:darkred;"} or [endurance]{style="color:darkred;"} 

## Psychological (micro-level): common traits [@Crenshaw1981] 

- [ego-defensive]{style="color:darkorange;"} needs
- [cognitive processes]{style="color:darkorange;"} 
- [socialisation]{style="color:darkorange;"} 

. . . 

- in interaction with a specific [situation]{style="color:cadetblue;"} 
- different acts of terror can carry differences in psychological demands
    + extremely discriminate (e.g., assassination) to broadly indiscriminate (recall [patterns of violence]{style="color:red;"} conceptual framework)

. . . 

BUT: avoid stereotyping the terrorist or oversimplifying: No single motivation or personality can be valid for all circumstances 

## Psychological (micro-level): normality [@Crenshaw1981] 

> "the outstanding common characteristic of terrorists is their [normality]{style="color:darkorange;"} "

. . . 

> The West German psychiatrist who conducted a pretrial examination of four members of the RAF concluded that they were "intelligent," even "humorous," and showed no symptoms of psychosis or neurosis and "no particular personality type." (p390)

## Psychological (micro-level): difficulties [@Crenshaw1981] 

studying individuals engaged in terrorism presents problems:

- [preconditions]{style="color:darkred;"} change over time and [precipitants]{style="color:darkred;"} are unpredictable
- interviewing terrorists: may discover [subsequent rationalisations]{style="color:darkorange;"} instead of prior attitudes/motivations

## Psychological (micro-level): endurance [@Crenshaw1981] 

Within terrorist groups, individual/group dynamics of ...

- commitment, 
- risk, 
- solidarity, 
- loyalty, 
- guilt, 
- revenge, 
- isolation

discourage a change in behaviour (and at the organisational level, strategy)---even when contextual conditions change.

## @Piazza2017 - testing causes

- Three groups of motivations (p. 54)
    + economic hardships and [grievances]{style="color:darkred;"} (mechanism: drive resentment and support for terrorism)
    + greater inclusion and empowerment of women and racial minorities (mechanism: [perceived threat]{style="color:darkred;"} to privilege)
    + resentment toward the U.S. political system and government (mechanism: necessitates 'resistance against tyranny')

Lays out differing theoretical/empirical contentions/findings about these motivations---and sets out to resolve them (theory-based and empirics-based [puzzles]{style="color:cadetblue;"}) [@day2019FindingQuestion]

<!-- ([Piazza, 2017, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/IERTEZ5Q)) THREE GROUPS OF MOTIVATIONS (TWO TYPES OF GRIEVANCE AND CHANGING OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE)   -->
<!-- economic hardships and grievances, produced by sectoral changes in the US economy—such as decline in manufacturing employment and crisis in the agricultural sector during the 1980s (known popularly as the ‘‘Farm Crisis’’)—that drive resentments and sup- port for terrorism, particularly among the white working class; societal changes that have led to greater inclusion and empowerment of women and racial minorities thereby producing a perceived challenge to traditional society and white male privilege or dominance, producing support for extremism and terrorism; and resentment toward the US political system and government, which is depicted in right-wing rhetoric as corrupt, tyrannical, unresponsive and unaccountable, prompting political violence as resistance against ‘‘big government’’ overreach and/or the exercise of political control by liberal-left government figures. All three of these categories of motivators8 contribute to conditions under which aggrieved individuals see political violence as a legitimate means to express their dissidence, communicate their opposition to the status quo, influence a wider audience or policy discus- sion, draw attention to their grievances, draw recruits and supporters and, ultimately if possible, cause a serious enough disruption to force the state into making concessions -->

## @Piazza2017 - research design

> the study uses a cross-sectional panel time series design to examine the predictive quality of a series of state and national-level economic, social and political indicators on counts of domestic terrorist attacks launched by right-wing terrorist movements and individuals in the 50 US states for the period 1970–2011.

The first is a measure of the percentage of the state population that lives below Federal Government-defined poverty levels reported in historical tables by the US Census Bureau.17 The second is a measure of the percentage of the population employed in manufacturing reported in the Economic Report of the President.18 The final economic measure attempts to capture long-term changes in agricultural livelihoods as well as the impact of the Farm Crisis by measuring the annual rate of change in the number of individual farms in a state using data obtained from US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, Farm Income and Wealth Statistics.19 -->

<!-- To operationalize factors present in hypotheses 4–6—which comprise the societal changes that challenge traditional social values and white male dominance category—I use three social and demographic indicators. The first is a state-level measure of the rate of medical abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44 obtained from the State Politics and the Judiciary dataset compiled by Lindquist (2007) and made available by the State Politics and Policy Quarterly (SPPQ) website.20 The second is a measure of female participation in the labor market—the percentage of the labor force that is female—obtained from the Economic Report of the President.21 The third is a measure of change (growth) of the non-white/ Caucasian population of the state, obtained from the US Census Bureau, ‘‘Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals by Race’’ -->

<!-- Finally, to operationalize the final three hypotheses, and their counters, in which the stateand national-level partisan control and ‘‘big government’’ policies drive terrorism, I use three indicators. The first is a measure of Democratic Party dominance at the state government level that uses an ordinal scale coded between 0 and 3 combining three dummy variables coded 1 for Democratic control over the lower state legislative house, the upper state legislative house and the governor’s mansion using data from the SPPQ database. The second is a simple dummy variable measuring whether or not the US President is a Democrat. The third is a measure of the average US Federal Income Tax rate for all households -->

## Reading a regression table

<!-- http://svmiller.com/blog/2014/08/reading-a-regression-table-a-guide-for-students/ -->

Remember: regression is a tool for understanding a phenomenon as a linear function (generally) &rarr; (y = mx + b)

1. Numbers not in parentheses next to a variable: [regression coefficient]{style="color:blue;"}: expected change in DV for a one-unit increase in IV. NB: ositive or negative relationship?

2. Numbers inside parentheses next to a variable: [standard error]{style="color:blue;"}: estimate of the standard deviation of the coefficient

3. Asterisks/'stars': [statistical significance]{style="color:blue;"}: probability of results as extreme as observed result, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. Smaller p-value means such an observation would be less likely under null hypothesis; hence, significance. Statistical significance suggests more precise estimates---NOT necessarily that one IV is more important than another.


## @Piazza2017 - abridged regression table

![](slide_files/02/piazza_reg_table.png)

## @Piazza2017 - findings (interpetting reg. table)

- right-wing terrorism [not rooted in economic grievances]{style="color:darkorange;"}, economic stress, or structural economic change
- 'gendered' dimension to right-wing extremist activity: [where women are becoming more empowered, right-wing terrorism is more frequent]{style="color:darkorange;"}
    + predictors associated with women’s rights significantly boost the incidence of right-wing terrorism
    + "*On average, increases in state-level abortion rates or women’s participation in the workforce produce fewer than 0.05 more right-wing terrorist attacks per state per year*."
- of 'big gov.' motivations, only the dummy variable for a Democrat U.S. President is significant
    + suggests [only peak-level and highly visible political predictors]{style="color:darkorange;"} are associated with increased incidence of right-wing terrorism

<!-- FIGURE 2 SHOWS ... predictors associated with women’s rights significantly boost the incidence of right-wing terrorism in the USA, but are minimal contributors to terrorism compared with other factors. On average, increases in state-level abortion rates or women’s participation in the workforce produce fewer than 0.05 more right-wing terrorist attacks per state per year. -->

## @Piazza2017 - conclusions

1. economic factors are not reliable predictors of terrorist activity

2. social factors help drive right-wing terrorism. ('ills afflicting "traditional" American society')

3. partisan control over government matters at the national level, but not the state level, in determining right-wing terrorism
