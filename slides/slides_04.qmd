[Foreign fighters are individuals who travel to a conflict zone from another territory. In other words, foreign fighters are individuals who *[engage]{style="color:darkred;"}* [remember, about behaviours] in violent activity, which also suggests they have *[radicalised]{style="color:darkred;"}* [remember, about attitudes] to some extent.

2. Elaborate in detail  
:::

[Foreign fighters travel to engage in violent conflict. They might do so for ideological reasons (including religious motivations), for material benefit, or because of connection to others who travel to the conflict zone (network/interpersonal causes). The extent of radicalisation underlying these reasons for becoming a foreign fighter vary, but the engagement in violence is clear. Given the fighters' engagement in violence and possible criminal consequences of their activities, home countries face a challenge of how to deal with their return. Broadly, state authorities might praise returning foreign fighters, ignore/disregard, refer to intervention programmes, arrest and/or prosecute, or even take measures to prevent their return (e.g., revoke citizenship) ...]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[Recent research on ISIS foreign fighters [@morris2023WhoBecomesForeign] identified common profiles for foreign fighters in the conflict in Syria: young, male, unmarried, urban, well-educated. These characteristics might be applicable to other cases. To assess whether such profiles of foreign fighters are generalizable, one might examine foreign fighters in historical cases, such as the Spanish Civil War where whole brigades of combatants were composed of volunteers from abroad, or contemporary conflicts, such as the Russian war on Ukraine where foreign fighters have formed part of both sides of the conflict. In any case, foreign fighters returning to their home countries can pose a dilemma for state authorities. German state authorities, for instance, might praise and heroise, such as (some) UK authorities did for fighters returning from Spain in the 1930s; the state might criminalise them, prosecuting and jailing for violent activity, such as with some fighters for ISIS returning from Syria...]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[The existence of foreign fighters is a longstanding and common form of political violence. Their motivations and characteristics may vary, but by definition they all engage in violence. Their exposure to and engagement in violence can pose threats to their home state and society when they return from conflict zones. States therefore may respond in several ways to minimise the danger of fighters acting violent upon their return.]{style="font-size:23px;"}

## Basic, intuitive definition of *strategy*

[strategy]{style="color:darkred;"} refers to the approach of an actor(s) to achieve their (political) objectives---connecting [actions]{style="color:red;"} to [goals]{style="color:red;"} (*means* to an *end*)

. . . 

- extant definitions identify some elements, e.g.,
    + "a combination of a claim (or demand), a tactic, and a site (or venue)" (Meyer 2007, 82)
    + @Ganz2010[p. 9]: targeting, tactics, timing
        * some overlap with the '[patterns of violence]{style="color:cadetblue;"}' framework discussed in [Class 1](https://michaelzeller.de/course-pv/content/#class-1)

. . . 

- BUT strategy does NOT always or in every situation include using violent tactics 
    + many groups use [mixed strategies]{style="color:goldenrod;"} of [violence]{style="color:violet;"} and [non-violence]{style="color:seagreen;"}

## Elements of strategy 

- informative element: [objective(s)]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (*why*): what are the actor(s) goals? [minimalist]{style="color:darkred;"} vs. [maximalist]{style="color:darkred;"} objectives

. . . 

- [target]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (what/who) - what entity is being acted upon? 
    + involves choice to commit resources to specific outcomes

. . . 

- [tactics]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (how) - types of collective action and their form
    + attempt to deploy *strengths*, exploit target's *weaknesses*

. . . 

- [site/venue]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (where) - what place or what forum type is action taken? 

. . . 

- [timing]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (when) - when are tactics employed against targets
    + 'some moments, often fleeting, promise greater opportunity than others' ... [cf. @Grzymala-Busse2011]

## Elements of strategy 

- informative element: [objective(s)]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (*why*): what are the actor(s) goals? [minimalist]{style="color:darkred;"} vs. [maximalist]{style="color:darkred;"} objectives
- [target]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (what/who) - what entity is being acted upon? 
- [tactics]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (how) - types of collective action and their form
- [site/venue]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (where) - what place or what forum type is action taken? 
- [timing]{style="color:cadetblue;"} (when) - when are tactics employed against targets

**[What are the strategic elements of politically violent groups you know?]{style="color:indigo; font-size:60px;"}** 
:::

## Drivers of strategy selection 

- [strategy]{style="color:darkred;"} is be a product of (rational) choice

BUT...

. . . 

- it is also a part [collective identity]{style="color:darkred;"} [cf. @PollettaJasper2001]
    + strategy also involves *moral and emotional committments*

## An example from 'the 43 Group'

post-war Labour government, witnessing low-level fascist-party organising and agitation...

@Beckman2013: 

> On Tuesday May 21st [1946], [James] Chuter Ede, the Home Secretary, received a deputation from the JDC [Jewish Defence Committee, part of the Board of Deputies of British Jews] led by the Chairman, Gordon Liverman ... They listened to the deputation and said they would consider all the points raised, but nothing tangible happened.

## 'maximalist' goals and concomitant strategies

@Piven1979[pp. xxi-xxii]

> ... by endeavoring to do what they cannot do, organizers fail to do what they can do... all too often, when workers erupted in strikes, organizers collected dues cards; when tenants refused to pay rent and stood off marshals, organizers formed building committees; when people were burning and looting, organizers used that 'moment of madness' to draft constitutions.

## Points for consideration 

- [Higher institutionalisation discourages the use of violence]{style="color:darkorange;"} [@Caiani2012, p. 14] 
    + the case of FARC argues against this hypothesis 
        * FARC was disciplined and had stringent rules, decided on an overall strategy through organisational conferences and they were resource-rich - i.e., a high degree of institutionalisation
    + there is no straightforward [deterministic relationship]{style="color:blue;"} between institutionalisation and (violent) strategy selection

- FARC violence used strategically and not randomly ... more likely to be exercised when it can be legitimised, **but also that the members adhered to this strategy**. *How and why does FARC manage to maintain this discipline?* - [Possible explanations?]{style="color:indigo;"}

> Whenever an underground organisation resorts to [using explosives]{style="color:red;"}---rather than executions with handguns---the results of its actions take an [unpredictable turn]{style="color:red;"}, despite precautions by the perpetrators, when it is not their intention to cause the largest possible number of victims. The intention to kill or not to kill targets is part and parcel of the strategy of an illegal political group but the number affected cannot be planned beforehand.

## ETA - strategic use of violence 

- intense post-truce actions
- ahead of negotiations
- during elections

## ETA [@lafaye2022MethodologicalApproachEvolution, p. 2471] 

> ETA endeavoured to take its place on the public scene, as a political player. It did this in various ways: either by **[increasing the intensity of its actions after a truce had been broken]{style="color:cadetblue;"}**, or to influence the "balance of the dialogue" **[before negotiations]{style="color:cadetblue;"}**; or **[during elections, when democratic structures were just beginning to be established]{style="color:cadetblue;"}** in Spain, i.e. in the 1970s, and in the early 2000s, or **[when political negotiations were being held in civil society]{style="color:cadetblue;"}** so that they could influence the search for a solution to the conflict.

## Selecting (and maintaining) nonviolence [@MironovaWhitt2022]

- those who experienced "abuse at the hands of government forces are more likely to justify violence in response to government provocation." 
    + BUT "*socializing effects of nonviolent activism*" builds self-discipline and restraint
    + "*[we also find that identity and associational cleavages and divisions within a movement need not undermine protest commitment and dedication to non-violence.]{style="color:darkorange;"}*"

- ... "Saunders et al. (2012) who urge scholars ‘to avoid treating protesters as a homogenous group’ (p. 263), distinguishing instead among [novices]{style="color:red;"}, [returners]{style="color:red;"}, [repeaters]{style="color:red;"}, and [stalwarts]{style="color:red;"}."
