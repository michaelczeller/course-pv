    "text": "Course description\n\nThis course will introduce students to the major aspects of (non-state) political violence by presenting research covering violent extremism and terrorism, radicalisation and deradicalisation, repression, demobilisation. We will consider why people and groups use political violence and how, its range of effects, how states and others react. Students will acquire both substantive knowledge of these research fields—especially through the repeated examination of important cases, such as political violence in Germany and in other countries—and the ability to evaluate research therein. Students should be prepared for reading and discussion of difficult topics, which can be unsettling."
