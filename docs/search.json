We will consider why people and groups use political violence and how, its range of effects, how states and others react. Students will acquire both substantive knowledge of these research fields—especially through the repeated examination of important cases, such as political violence in Germany and in other countries—and the ability to evaluate research therein. Students should be prepared for reading and discussion of difficult topics, which can be unsettling."

A presentation of a method should introduce the method, explain how (e.g., for what research topics) it is useful for studying political violence, and (most importantly) discuss at least one example of applied research. For example, a group could present regression analysis by briefly reviewing the logic of regression techniques, explaining that it is useful for detecting correlations in large sets of data, and explaining how Authors X & Y used regression analysis techniques on incidents of political violence within a country.\nWhile students may choose any method after conferring with the instructor, the following is a list of some methods that would be suitable for presentation: linear regression, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), network analysis, experimental design, content/discourse analysis, quantitative text analysis, process tracing, spatial analysis, ethnography.\nStudents are responsible for creating their own group and organising their presentation.

    "text": "Essay (Hausarbeit)\nStudents that are required by their degree programme to write a final essay will write an analytical data report on a political violence phenomenon, such as incidents of political violence in Europe (or in a specific country, or in a sub-national area) or online posting activity by known politically violent groups. The report should be 2000-3000 words (excluding citations). It should briefly introduce the subject, briefly discuss relevant research literature, and (particularly important) should gather and present (in a tablular and/or graphic format) some data relevant to understanding the political violence phenomenon (e.g., a report on a politically violent group might present violent incidents associated with that group; or a report on online activity might present the quantity and characteristics of online posts by the platform account associated with a group(s)). Please note that introduction and literature review are to be brief. The intention of this report is for you to gather data and generate analytical insights. Imagine that you are describing this political violence phenomenon to someone (a policymaker or researcher) with no specific knowledge of it; your job is to provide context briefly, offer specific knowledge, and why that knowledge is important.\nStudents are generally free to choose their topic and have it confirmed by the instructor—though the instructor may veto a topic and assign another, or ask the student to choose another. At least one rule applies: no drawing any data from or citing Statista or other data curation services.  Prior to the end of the semester, students intending to write the essay should submit a one-page synopsis that states your topic, lists some relevant research sources, describes the parameters of the data (i.e., variables, number of observations—think of writing up a mini-codebook) and presents a few example rows (i.e., observations), lists any ideas on how to present the data (i.e., how you will visualise it in your report), and identifies any particular points on which you need preliminary feedback. (This is your chance to get risk-free feedback on your work. Embrace it!) Feedback on the synopsis may direct students to revise their topic, focus on other sources, and/or reconsider their data approach to their proposed report.\n\nDeadline for short synopsis submission: 2026-01-17\nDeadline for full report submission (including full dataframe): 2026-03-07\nDue to time constraints, no written preliminary feedback can be provided after the synopsis submission deadline. Students requesting such feedback will receive the following response: “Unfortunately, I am unable to provide feedback at this time. But I suggest you look at the assignment description, the scoring rubric, and the example data report—all provided on the course website.”\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the instructor may accept late submissions of the full report due to unforeseen circumstances. Generally, late submissions will be marked down 0,3 for every two days it is not submitted. If foreseen circumstances make the deadline impossible, please speak to the instructor to make an alternative arrangement.\nAn example data report is provided on this website. It is a slightly modified version of a previous student’s submission and shows an example of a very good data report.\nFinally, a suggested (purely voluntary, but perhaps to your ultimate benefit) mode of conducting work on your report: students may find it advantageous to work in R and Rstudio. This is a powerful data management and analysis tool. It combines the capability to import and visualise data, conduct sophisticated analyses, and even present them in nicely formatted documents (whether Word, PDF, or HTML). Students interested in working with datasets in their theses, going on to advanced academic studies, or pursuing a career in research will benefit enormously from engaging with this tool early and often. The course introduction will provide some tips for using this tool. For further information, please turn to the vast material related to R online or inquire with the instructor. Nevertheless, students are free to work with whatever tools they are most comfortable with, including Microsoft Office programmes.\nOnce you have read this far: please send me an email before second class stating your favourite city and what (if any) politically violent groups you are particularly interested in learning about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria and Indicators\n\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\n- Does the introduction clearly introduce the topic and related data?\n- Does the introduction briefly state any information or context that is essential to understanding the topic and/or data?\n- Does the introduction state the aim of the report?\n- Does the introduction summarise the structure of the report and the main findings?\n\n\n2. Literature and concepts\n- Does the report have a section on relevant literature and concepts related to their topic and data?\n- Does the section provide detailed systematised concept(s) to understand the rest of the data report?\n- Does the section provide the contextual information necessary to understand the rest of the data report?\n\n\n3. Data description\n- Does the data description explain how the data were collected or created?\n- Does the data description report the (most important) variables and overall data structure (e.g., one row is an observation of what)?\nDoes the data description provide any necessary descriptive statistics (e.g., number of observations, range/mean/median, missing observations)?\n- Does the data description reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying source of the data?\n\n\n4. Data presentation\n- Are the data presented in a tabular and graphical format?\n- Is the presentation readable and readily interpretable (e.g., clear labels, legends)?\n- Is the presentation directly connected to the analytical discussion?\n\n\n5. Analytical insights\n- Does the report discuss (descriptive) analytical insights enabled by presentation of the data and closer inspection of certain data points or collections of data points?\n- Is the report cautious about the limits of how much we can interpret the data (e.g., how certain can we be of any trends; how plausible is any speculation about causes?)?\n\n\n6.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe far-right phenomenon in Germany is frequently discussed in media and public discourse. Far-right agitation can take various forms: the far right is organisationally diverse, encompassing parties, movements, movement-parties, groupuscules, networks, lone actors and more (Castelli Gattinara & Pirro, 2018). In Germany, much scholarly attention has been directed towards the realm of far-right party politics; much less towards smaller-scale right-wing extremist incidents.\n\nThis data report aims to provide an overview of different types of activities assigned to a far-right ideology in a specific regional and temporal context. By focusing on these activities rather than individual parties or groups, this study seeks to identify symptomatic behaviours and incipient processes of radicalisation. In particular, this report draws on data from Bavaria, especially Munich.\nThe Antifaschistische Informations-, Dokumentations- und Archivstelle München e. V. (a.i.d.a.) provides a detailed chronology of incidents of far-right activity in Bavaria. This report draws on the last twelve months of this chronology, encompassing all listed incidents, including minor actions such as pasting far-right stickers. (Such minor incidents may be significant, for example indicating the presence of a far-right group or individual in a particular area.)\nThe report is structured as follows: first, it briefly discusses some theoretical foundations. Then, it outlines the development of the far-right in Bavaria after 1945. Next, it introduces the data, including novel coding work. The report discusses what the data show and concludes by summarising and discussing possible limitations."

    "text": "The far right in Germany and Bavaria\nIn the post-war era, far-right activity has been present in Bavaria, manifesting in different forms and intensities over time (cf. Pfahl-Traughber 2019). This overview aims to provide context for the data by examining the development of far-right structures in the region.\nHere, the term right-wing terrorism refers to violent acts committed with a racist or anti-Semitic motive, linked to central far-right ideological tenets (nationalism, exclusionism, xenophobia, nativism, authoritarianism and populism, Mudde 2019). Incidents of right-wing terrorism increased in the 1960s, driven by nationalist and anti-communist sentiments. During the 1970s, Jewish institutions and representatives became more frequent targets.\nIn the 1990s, a wave of attacks on refugees and migrant workers epitomised a spike in far-right violence in Germany, particularly in eastern regions (Virchow 2022). The total extent of far-right violence during this period is unclear due to inconsistent classification practices1 and under-reporting issues, but official figures from German law enforcement authorities (i.e., Bundeskriminalamt) show a sharp increase in far-right violence. Moreover, places such as Rostock-Lichtenhagen, Solingen, Mölln, and Hoyerswerda witnessed highly visible racist attacks and pogroms.\nSince the reunification of Germany in 1990 various forms of far-right structures have existed in Bavaria, including parties, non-party organisations, associations, and fraternities. Some parties include Die Republikaner, Deutsche Volksunion, and currently the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). There are active movement-parties like the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) (cf. Vollhardt 2024) and Der III. Weg. There are far-right fraternities like the Burschenschaft Danubia München and Teutonia Prag zu Würzburg, which organise events and have links to other far-right organisations. Movement organisations include the AfD’s youth group Junge Alternative (JA) and spin-offs of the Identitarian movement: Requonquista 21, Lederhosen Revolte, and Isar Legion. \nOverall, this overview demonstrates the persistent presence of far-right structures and activity in Bavaria since 1945."

V. (a.i.d.a.) contains data on far-right activities in Bavaria, particularly Munich, extending back decades. The chronology is structured temporally, logging the date of the incident and providing a short description. The aim of this report is to focus on activities from the last year.\nBased on the descriptions, I assigned non-mutually exclusive categorical codes to each incident. Seven categories, inductively drawn from the descriptions, are included:\n\nvandalism: incidents of graffiti, tags, and damage. Stickers, for example, by far-right movements like the Identiterians are also included here;\nparoles: incidents where (often intoxicated) people shouted xenophobic paroles without addressing a specific person;\nsymbols: graffiti and tags that are explicitly forbidden, such as the swastika or SS-runes. It furthermore includes the use of these symbols on apparel or tattoos as well as the use of the Hitlergruß;\nviolence: all physical offences against people, physical attacks and also offences like spitting;\nthreat: all kinds of threats of violence, such as hate-mail addressed to politicians as well as reported digital threats;\ninsult: non-physical attacks against people, like racist, antisemitic, or homophobic insults;\nevents: meetings and non-public assemblies of far-right actors, such as lectures at far-right fraternities.\n\nSeveral categories can apply to one incident: for instance, an incident of vandalism may also involve the use of illegal symbols (e.g., a swastika) and a threat.\nNote that the coding deals with incidents, an occurrence on a particular date, not actors. Sometimes these incidents involve one actor, multiple, or none at all. By coding incidents, it is far-right activity data that is generated. As mentioned above, the last year of activity was coded, June 2023 to May 2024. There are 137 incidents for this period. To these incidents, 232 categories were coded. Together, these data enable a descriptive analysis of far-right activity over the past year.\nA couple limitations to the data deserve mention at the outset. First, the data relies on published reports from police and news services, so they do not reflect all incidents of far-right activity but merely those that are reported on. Someone’s property might be affected by vandalism, for example, and it might not be captured in the data if they do not report it. Second, the data focus on Munich, but also offers coverage of elsewhere in Bavaria. The data do not cover all incidents (again, only those that are reported), but there is probably an under-reporting issue for places outside of Munich. It is not entirely clear from a.i.d.a.’s website hoe they assemble their chronology, but it seems probable that, since the archive is based in Munich and since (more generally) there are more news reports and police coverage in Munich, that the incidents reported are biased towards Munich compared to the rest of Bavaria."

The meeting organised by Reconquista 21 and the Identiterians in Dasing, noted in the Bavarian Verfassungsschutz report, was in the chronology. The other event took place on 23 June in Munich: the fraternity Stauffia organised a summer event that promoted radical libertarian and anti-democratic ideology. Here is a demonstration of the role of fraternities in networking far-right actors. Other agitations like demonstrations, protests, leafletting and petitioning were not recorded in the a.i.d.a. chronology for the past year.\nVandalism accounts for the highest number of incidents in the last year of the a.i.d.a. chronology. This category encompasses a wide range of incidents that demonstrate an obvious far-right motivation, including various forms of graffiti, tags, and damage. This category also includes stickers from far-right groups, which were increasingly found in the south of Munich during the summer of 2023, particularly those bearing the logo of the Identitarian movement.\nCases involving explicitly forbidden NS-symbols, such as the swastika or SS-runes, are recorded under the category of “symbols”. They are indicative of an ideological connection to neo-Nazism. This category also encompasses instances where individuals performed the “Hitlergruß” (‘Hitler greeting’) or displayed NS-symbols in the form of T-shirt prints or tattoos. The frequency of swastika graffiti was striking, highlighting the prevalence of far-right ideologies and symbols in public spaces.\nThe categories “vandalism” and “symbols” together represent a majority of incidents documented by the a.i.d.a. chronology. These two categories provide insight into the extent to which far-right groups or individuals are engaging in destructive behaviour aimed at promoting their ideology or intimidating marginalised communities.\nVerbal attacks, captured by the category “insult,” were also a common occurrence and the third most frequent type of incident. This category includes all forms of discriminatory verbal attacks motivated by racism, homophobia, xenophobia, or antisemitism. In some cases, perpetrators escalated from verbal threats to physical violence.\nIt is important to distinguish between instances where individuals are explicitly targeted with discriminatory language and those where they engage in aimless shouting of slogans, often without addressing a specific person. The category “paroles” was created to capture the latter incident, which includes incidents where individuals, frequently intoxicated or mentally unstable, shout discriminatory phrases without directly targeting anyone.\nThere is thus a meaningful subdivision among the categories: between those covering direct attacks against individuals (insult, threat, violence) and those encompassing instances where far-right actors promote their ideology through more conspicuous signs (vandalism, symbols, events, paroles). These two types of categories likely have different effects on individuals and communities and require distinct measures to prevent and address them. In the case of direct attacks against individuals, swift action is necessary to protect those affected and prevent future occurrences. These incidents can also be linked to other types of far-right activities, such as vandalism. However, monitoring instances where perpetrators draw attention to themselves through more subtle means (vandalism, symbols, events, paroles) is crucial for understanding their motivations and connections to far-right groups or parties or broader far-right ideological strains.\nBy documenting these incidents closely, it becomes possible to identify patterns and trends in far-right activities, which can inform strategies aimed at preventing such incidents and promoting greater safety and inclusivity within communities.\n\nThe course of events\nFigure 1 shows the development of incidents over time. There is a conspicuous rise in incidents of vandalism in August and September 2023. The explanation for this aberrant spike of incidents seems fairly clear: Bavarian regional election took place in September 2023. Several incidents in the run up to the election involved vandalism against election posters. Notably, posters from the Green party were disproportionately targeted by vandals during this period, for example (auto-translated with El-Desouky’s gtranslate package):\n\nMunich. The “B90/The Green” state parliament member Benjamin Adjei reports on several hostility and attacks. Towards the end of July two election posters from Adjei were only lit racist (“N ****, no thanks”). On another poster, a gunshot wound on his face was symbolized with down -flowing blood. Other poster wood stands were also met.

The reasons for this could be many, but Shoshan’s (2016, e.g., p. 97) reflection on the thorough enforcement of laws against proscribed symbols could be instructive for why this crime/incident accounts for such a large number of incidents.\nViolence seem to be rare, accounting for only 18 incidents over the past year—and none since January (as of July 2024). There are no incidents of lethal violence. Several cases involve aggression towards persons with a migration background, for example, an incident from 24 June 2023:\n\nSchweinfurt. A 21 and a 29-year-old offend a 33-year-old man with Rwandian migration history at the main train station on Saturday morning, hit him in the face and throw it with change. The heavily alcoholic men are arrested and displayed. The affected person does not suffer any injuries in need of treatment. Source: Press release from the Lower Franconia police headquarters of June 24, 2023.\n\nAnother such case occurred on 18 December 2023:\n\nMunich. A 73-year-old senior citizen attacks a 31-year-old woman with a Chinese family history at 9:00 a.m. at 9:00 a.m. When the aggressor wants to flee and stands in the way of a 48-year-old, she also puts it on the face. Source: Press release from the Federal Police Directorate in Munich of December 19, 2023.\n\nThis sort of aggression or violence seems to fit with the typical image of far-right violence, that is, motivated by racist or xenophobic attitudes."

    "section": "Conclusions",
    "text": "Conclusions\nIt is essential to note that the data presented and discussed in this report are not representative of all far-right incidents that occurred during this period. The a.i.d.a. chronology includes only a selection of cases, those reported in police statements or public media or reported to a.i.d.a. itself. Consequently, it should be acknowledged that not every incident with a far-right motivation that took place within the last 12 months may be accounted for in this analysis.\nThis report presented a descriptive analysis, noting the prevalence of vandalism and symbol incidents, especially preceding Bavaria’s regional elections. It also noted that recorded incidents of aggression or violence fit the stereotypical image of far-right violence: motivated by racism or xenophobia.\nTo go beyond this reports descriptive analysis would involve the challenging task of determining the underlying motivations behind specific incidents. From a cursory reading of the incident descriptions, it is sometimes difficult to say with certainty whether far-right ideology was the primary driving force behind these events. This is especially so for the “paroles” category of incidents, where individuals engage in discriminatory behaviour while intoxicated or confused.\nDespite these and previously discussed limitations, the data from the a.i.d.a. chronology provide insights into far-right activities in Munich and Bavaria. While much research on the far right in Germany focuses on existing structures and organisations, how they have endured and changed in the post-war era, the a.i.d.a. data reflects activity not organisation or even necessarily organised activity. Most of the incidents make no reference to specific far-right organisations. Instead, the record of incidents are more akin to attitudinal surveys: they show the prevalence of certain attitudes, ideologies, differing from surveys in that the incidents reflect action on behalf of those attitudes.\nThe data from the a.i.d.a. offers ongoing monitoring of far-right activities in Munich and Bavaria, building on research of far-right movements in Germany and Bavaria after 1945 (Manthe 2021). Further research could use this data to examine the interplay between seemingly insignificant events and larger ideological structures and indeed organisational ecologies. Researchers can thereby gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics driving far-right movements in this region."

This begins with understanding that ‘far right’ is a contested term used to describe an indeterminate and diverse set of cases. We will look at how research (and by extension, law and policy) has variously defined far right. We will look at the ideology that serves to motivate organisations and actors we encounter later in the course. This part will help students to evaluate published work on far-right politics and protest, and to situate their own research within relevant conceptual frameworks."

To make this transition, we consider the liminal cases that are often called ‘movement-parties’ and, more broadly, consider the relationship between far-right movements and aligned parties. In the sphere of social mobilisation and movement activism, how does far-right activity manifest? Are far-right movements akin to other social movements or some sui generis category? How do other movement actors respond to the far right and to what effect? And why and how do far-right movements falter, fail, and demobilise? These questions take us into a dynamic and highly active field of contemporary research."

    "section": "Examination (Klausur)",
    "text": "Examination (Klausur)\nStudents will not have an examination in this course, but they will in the ‘Einführung Politisches System der BRD’ course. During that examination, they will respond to one or more essay questions based on the content of this course.\n\nInformation on examination\nTypically, the examination is conducted over 90 minutes and will take the following form: for the lecture (‘Einführung Politisches System der BRD’) portion, students will be given five short answer (i.e., one or two paragraphs) questions; they should respond to three of the five. For the seminar (Grundkurs) portion, students will be given three essay prompts and they should respond to one of them.\nFor this course, students might receive an essay prompt like the following: What does the term ‘foreign fighter’ mean? Who becomes a foreign fighter? How can ‘home’ countries deal with returning foreign fighters?\nA good response to this prompt (and others) would likely consist of four parts: (1) Broad introductory response; (2) Elaborate in (sufficient) detail to answer the questions; (3) Describe examples; (4) Concluding summary.\n\nBroad introductory response, e.g.:\n\nForeign fighters are individuals who travel to a conflict zone from another territory. In other words, foreign fighters are individuals who engage [remember, about behaviours] in violent activity, which also suggests they have radicalised [remember, about attitudes] to some extent. Home countries have a variety of options for dealing with returning foreign fighters …\n\nElaborate in (sufficient) detail to answer the questions, e.g.:\n\nForeign fighters travel to engage in violent conflict. They might do so for ideological reasons (including religious motivations), for material benefit, or because of connection to others who travel to the conflict zone (network/interpersonal causes). The extent of radicalisation underlying these reasons for becoming a foreign fighter vary, but the engagement in violence is clear. Given the fighters’ engagement in violence and possible criminal consequences of their activities, home countries face a challenge of how to deal with their return. Broadly, state authorities might praise returning foreign fighters, ignore/disregard, refer to intervention programmes, arrest and/or prosecute, or even take measures to prevent their return (e.g., revoke citizenship). …\n\nDescribe examples, e.g.:\n\nRecent research on ISIS foreign fighters (Morris 2023) identified common profiles for foreign fighters in the conflict in Syria: young, male, unmarried, urban, well-educated. These characteristics might be applicable to other cases. To assess whether such profiles of foreign fighters are generalizable, one might examine foreign fighters in historical cases, such as the Spanish Civil War where whole brigades of combatants were composed of volunteers from abroad, or contemporary conflicts, such as the Russian war on Ukraine where foreign fighters have formed part of both sides of the conflict. In any case, foreign fighters returning to their home countries can pose a dilemma for state authorities. German state authorities, for instance, might praise and heroise, such as (some) UK authorities did for fighters returning from Spain in the 1930s; the state might criminalise them, prosecuting and jailing for violent activity, such as with some fighters for ISIS returning from Syria. …\n\nConcluding summary, e.g.:\n\nThe existence of foreign fighters is a longstanding and common form of political violence. Their motivations and characteristics may vary, but by definition they all engage in violence. Their exposure to and engagement in violence can pose threats to their home state and society when they return from conflict zones. States therefore may respond in several ways to minimise the danger of fighters acting violent upon their return."

With these essential descriptive questions addressed, we proceed to the matter of how political violence emerges: how individuals and groups radicalise and how they move towards performing violence."

Further in this direction, we consider the dynamics of escalation and, conversely, restraint that manifests in politically violent groups.

Given its contemporary importance, we add to this a specific examination of how violent actors can be addressed in online spaces. Our last two sessions focus on how these external responses (and other factors) drive individuals to cease their political violence and groups to give up on the strategy."
